Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

1) I’m a QA Automation Engineer with over 6 years of experience designing automation frameworks for enterprise data platforms.
2) I have specialized in Playwright with TypeScript, using Page Object Model and BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) with Cucumber, and have hands-on experience with tools like Selenium, Rest Assured, Postman, and SQL. 
3) We have integrated automation into CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, with reporting through Cucumber. 
4) The application I worked on was an ETL-based DataOps platform. My role was to ensure that data was extracted, transformed, and loaded correctly across enterprise pipelines. 
5) I validated the UI where users configured ETL workflows, and I also tested backend APIs and databases to ensure transformations, mappings, and data loads produced accurate and consistent results end to end. 
6) I’ve automated over 1,500 scenarios, reduced manual regression effort by 60–70%, and helped cut production-critical defects by shifting validation earlier in the pipeline.
7) I have good exposure on agile base systems, and I have been using jira, zoho for bug reporting, and we have 2 weeks of sprint, so I know how to work with sprint closely working with different stakeholders
