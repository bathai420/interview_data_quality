When faced with uncertainty, it is crucial to identify the situation and explore potential alternatives to overcome it. 

I had to rely on my skill set to make the best decision, even without having all the necessary information. 

For example, one of the columns had insufficient data, so I reached out to the client to review the source and resend the complete data. 
However, this process took longer than expected. To meet the deadline, I had to reduce my scope of work, after discussing the situation with my lead and the business owner.
