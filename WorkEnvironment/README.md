I will start with my past experience

1) I use to have daily sprint meetings as we follow agile methodology.
2) I also have a daily call with client to update data quality testing to discuss if any rules failed next steps.
3) I collaborate with other teams like reporting

In my next job i look for

1) Collaborative atmosphere.
2) I prefer open communication.
3) Team that i can seek guidance and support when needed.
4) Positive and supportive culture.
