I have been lately learning about Fraud Data, hear is what my understanding is:

Fraud data refers to information related to fraudulent activities, Such as
- Suspicious Transactions,
- Unusual patterns in user behaviours
- Large and sudden transactions from a new location, etc.

examples for fraud quality checks includes:

1) Ensure shipping and billing address matches with previous transactions.
2) Incomplete or suspicious details like missing phone numbers or fake emails.
3) Detect mismatches between past and current login locations.
4) Identify accounts making large purchases immediately after signup.
5) multiple failed login attempts.
6) multiple accounts using the same credit card.

I am yet to continue exploring more in this space.
