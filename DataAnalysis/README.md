[DataAnalysis](https://github.com/bathai420/interview_data_quality/blob/main/DataAnalysis/README.md)

In simple terms, Data Analysis refers to the process of collecting, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to uncover useful insights, make informed decisions, or solve business problems.

1) Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, whether it's from databases, surveys, online sources, or business systems.
2) Data Cleaning: Removing errors, filling in missing data, and ensuring the data is accurate and consistent.
3) Data Transformation: Manipulating or reshaping data into a more useful format, often using tools like Excel, SQL, or Python.
4) Data Interpretation: Drawing meaningful insights from the data to understand patterns, trends, and correlations.

Example: Imagine you are analyzing sales data from an online store. You might clean the raw sales data, categorize it by product, region, and customer demographic, and then identify trends like "Product A sells best in the East Coast during the holiday season."
