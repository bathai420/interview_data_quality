I am Interested in this role because, In past I have experience as a data quality engineer, so in my current masters project I choose to built symantic data type detection using data science model. So working at NFCU will help me to gain financial domain knowledge, Which will help me in my masters project

**_About project_**

Symantic data type detection can be used for data quality and data governance. I recently completed a draft for this project, The idea is to identify and tag business definition for each column by passing data through data science model. for example email, SSN, Zip code etc. Commonly, data is charactrized as strings, integers, date etc But this data science model will catagorize data as a symantic data types and also we can apply default data quality checks for each column using predefined templets. for example if it is an SSN column, the column length should be 9 of charactors, and email addresses are properly structured (e.g., 'user@example.com')

**_1st project_**

During my masters i completed an end to end full stack application, which is an web user interface. It is a book club, named Good reads where users can form a book club, share books and reviews and comments for books, set reading goals etc.
