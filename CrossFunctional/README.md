Previously, when I worked As a Data Quality Engineer, the very first step i take is to work closely with product owners to understand the business requirements. 

My second step is to ensure that the data pipelines built by data engineers cover various scenarios such as timeliness, accuracy and completness of the data. 

Later, i document all the information and present it to the data engineering team and business owners, highlighting any findings that need to be addressed. 

If they are not resolved the business owners will escalate them to the next step. 

This collaborative approach helped the project move forward smoothly, and we successfully met the deadlines.
