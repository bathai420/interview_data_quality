[Conflict](https://github.com/bathai420/interview_data_quality/blob/main/Conflict/README.md)


When faced with conflict, I prioritize open communication. 

I setup a call with the person i have conflict with, try to understand his point of view and explain my point of view from this we try to understand which one is aliged close to business needs and try to adopt it.
