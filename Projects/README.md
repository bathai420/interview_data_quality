#### Data Quality Engineer - Datagaps inc - Feb 2021 to Sep 2023
#### Client: United Health Care

As a Data Quality Engineer at Datagaps, I happen to work with Client (United Health Care), as it is a health care insurance company it has lots of data related to Patients, Providers, Insurance details, Claims, RX (Pharmacy) claims, Clinical information like Vitals, etc..

There was a use-case, to identify the patients who could have mental/behavioural issues and place them in-care. I worked closely with product owner to understand the requirements, worked with data engineers who built the pipelines, worked with Data science team who built data science model to identify the patients that require care.

My role was to ensure the integrity of the data pipeline by implementing data validation checks at the input stage. This included verifying data types, ranges, formats, missing values etc.. to prevent incorrect data from entering the system

Example: 
It is important to identify missing elements such as Patient Address, Patient Contact, Provider Address, and Provider Contact Information, among others. Once the data science model identifies patients who need care based on medical claims, the next step is to match them with the nearest provider. If address information is missing, we wonâ€™t be able to place the patient into care.

Using ETL validator, I was able to define the validations to make sure there no duplicates, no missing values on required column, and worked with data engineer to attach these check as part of their pipelines. United health care has Azure Databricks workspaces, I used Databricks notebooks to perform data analysis using SQL and Python

We have integrated the data quality results captured by ETL Validator into a report. I used that report to monitor the pipeline health, react to any issues by analysing the data, document and share with product owners


OPTIONAL: We have also done few other validations like timeliness, completeness and consistency
