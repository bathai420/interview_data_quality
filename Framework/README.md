1) I’ve been working on a Playwright-based automation framework built with TypeScript, designed for enterprise-level applications.
2) At a high level, the framework follows a centralized configuration, environment-based execution, cross-browser support, and parallel execution to reduce overall execution time.
3) We follow a BDD approach using Cucumber and Gherkin, which makes scenarios business-readable and improves collaboration between QA, developers, and stakeholders.
4) For UI automation, the framework follows Page Object Model where pages contain locators and actions, step definitions handle assertions using these actions, and feature files define business-readable scenarios. 
5) The framework also integrates API automation using Playwright’s API capabilities. We validate REST and GraphQL APIs, handle authentication flows, and use APIs for test data seeding, which enables efficient end-to-end validation. 
6) For reporting, we use Cucumber reports that provide detailed execution results, step-level status, screenshots on failure, and logs. These reports are easily consumable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders and are integrated into CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins. 
7) Overall, the framework has significantly reduced flaky tests, improved execution stability, and provided faster feedback. I’ve actively contributed to framework design, BDD implementation, locator stability, API integration, reporting, and CI pipeline support.
