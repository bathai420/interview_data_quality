I take proactive approach to develop new skills whether it's mastering a new programming language or new data governance tool.

Iam committed to continuous learning to maximize my value to the team and drive collective success as a team.

As i had to support various clients in my previous work space, I had to learn how to use different databases like postgres, mysql, sql server, oracle

to learn new skill I broke down the learning process into manageable steps, first do research on internet, watching tutorials, then practicing on small tasks, and seeking feedback from colleagues.
